# copress-dashboard — The Publishing Spine

**Live:** https://copress-dashboard.vercel.app  
**Stack:** Static HTML/CSS/JS · Vercel · GitHub auto-deploy

SATCOM is the command center for copress.news — a Colorado mountain newspaper network covering Black Hawk, Central City, Nederland, Georgetown, and Idaho Springs.

## SATCOM / SATCO Brand Lane

- **SATCOM:** main dashboard title and operator command surface.
- **SATCO Academy:** staff learning lane, including the Daily Quick training prompt.
- **NationalIntelligence.com:** brand domain for the aerospace-intelligence staff academy concept.
- **Asset rule:** use original aerospace/SATCOM styling only; do not reuse official government seals as brand marks.

## Sidebar Navigation

**Admin section**
- Admin HQ — primary launch surface for operator tools
- CoPress Dashboard — `https://copress-dashboard.vercel.app/`
- Aileen / Hermes WebUI — `http://127.0.0.1:8787/`
- Hermes Agent diagnostics — `http://127.0.0.1:9119/sessions`

## Live Dashboard Data

The dashboard attempts to hydrate top-level cards from browser-stored API keys:

| Card | Values | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| Editorial Desk | Drafts, published count, this-week count, recent article queue | Supabase REST `public_posts` filtered by `site_key=registercall` |
| Marketing Hub | Subscriber count | Sendy `/api/subscribers/count` |

Keys are read from both the dashboard API panel (`copress_api_*`) and API Vault (`api_vault`), so either setup path works. Required values:

| Service | Required keys |
|---------|---------------|
| Supabase | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` |
| Sendy | `SENDY_URL`, `SENDY_API_KEY`, and at least one list ID (`SENDY_LIST_ID`, `SENDY_LIST_PAID`, `SENDY_LIST_EDITORIAL`, `SENDY_LIST_MARKETING`, or `SENDY_LIST_SALES`) |

If credentials are missing or the browser blocks the upstream request, the card keeps its fallback value and the status LED switches to warning.

---

## Press Atmosphere (Background Effects)

The main dashboard has a newspaper press atmosphere layer at `z-index:0`:

**Gears** — 5 SVG gears with machine-cut teeth, spokes, bolt-detail circles:
- Gear A: 440px, 14 teeth, dark teal-steel `#455a64`, 72s clockwise
- Gear B: 280px, 10 teeth, mid blue-steel `#607d8b`, 48s counter-clockwise
- Gear C: 160px, 8 teeth, light steel `#90a4ae`, 28s clockwise
- Gear D: 320px, 11 teeth, aged press steel `#4e6070`, 58s counter-clockwise
- Gear E: 140px, 7 teeth, brushed steel `#78909c`, 22s clockwise

**Spotlight** — 900px radial gradient drifts lazily in a 55-second 7-waypoint cycle. Warm parchment in light mode, gold tint in dark mode.

**Placeholder gear watermarks** — each under-construction view has a ghost gear at bottom-right, 40s rotation, ~6% opacity.

Implementation locations:
- CSS: `index.html` press-atmosphere rules, `#spotlight`, `#gears-svg`, and `.module-placeholder-gear-hint`
- HTML: `#spotlight` and `#gears-svg` injected before `</body>`
- JavaScript: `gearPath(...)`, SVG gear generation, and placeholder watermark injection near the bottom of `index.html`

The atmosphere layer sits below the app shell. `#spotlight` and `#gears-svg` render at `z-index:0`; the sidebar, topbar, and content shell stay above at `z-index:1`.

## Hermes / Aileen Local Surfaces

Hermes Agent has two separate local surfaces:

| URL | Purpose | Use for |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `https://copress-dashboard.vercel.app/` → Hermes Crew | CoPress operator front end | Chat, crew jobs, status, local endpoint links |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` | Aileen / Hermes WebUI | Canonical human operator dashboard for prompts, chat continuity, and local model routing |
| `http://127.0.0.1:9119/sessions` | Hermes Agent diagnostics | Raw sessions, analytics, models, logs, skills, plugins, profiles, config, keys |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8793` | Hermes Crew bridge | Local chat, crew run/status/result API, Qwen/Ollama routing |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8501` | Streamlit fallback | Local fallback chat and Crew Runner UI |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8642/v1` | OpenAI-compatible gateway | Open WebUI / API clients |

`http://127.0.0.1:8787/` is the canonical Aileen/Hermes operator dashboard. Individual `/session/...` URLs are chat threads inside that dashboard, not the canonical entry point. `http://127.0.0.1:9119/sessions` is diagnostics only. The diagnostics API under `/api/*` is session-protected and can return `401 {"detail":"Unauthorized"}` when called directly without the embedded dashboard session token. That is expected for raw API calls and does not mean Hermes is down.

For Open WebUI, point the OpenAI-compatible base URL at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8642/v1
```

The current gateway model id verified locally is `ollama-qwen`.

---

## Linear Integration (`/linear`)

Connects to Linear's GraphQL API (`https://api.linear.app/graphql`):

**Features:**
- Live issue list with priority icon, status dot, label, assignee, time ago
- Filter tabs: All / Urgent / In Progress / Todo / Done / Mine
- Inline search by title or identifier
- Quick-create bar: title + team + priority, Enter to submit
- Full create modal: title, description, team, priority, assignee, label
- Active cycle panel: progress bar, days remaining, breakdown
- Projects panel: icon, name, state, % complete
- Team members: avatar, email, issue count
- Click any issue → opens in Linear at correct team/issue URL

**Setup:** Enter Personal API key from `linear.app/settings/api` in the setup banner or Connection panel. Stored in `localStorage.linear_api_key` only — never transmitted externally.

---

## API Vault (`/apistore`)

Stores API keys in localStorage under `api_vault`. The dashboard also stores quick API panel values under `copress_api_*`.

| Key ID | Service |
|--------|---------|
| `google_places` | Google Places API |
| `apify_token` | Apify scraping |
| `gemini_key` | Google Gemini |
| `supabase_url` | Supabase project URL |
| `supabase_anon` | Supabase anon key |
| `sendy_url` | Sendy instance URL |
| `sendy_key` | Sendy API key |
| `sendy_list_id` / `SENDY_LIST_*` | Sendy subscriber list IDs |
| `stripe_secret` | Stripe secret key |

Agent handoff rule: never bulk-hand all keys to Hermes. Hermes/Aileen may request one named service credential for one task through a guarded local bridge or operator-reviewed export. Do not paste secrets into chat prompts, commit them, or store them in model/session config.

Export formats: selected `.env` values or JSON for local operator handoff only. MCP injection should be scoped to a service and reason.

## Network HQ (`/network`)

Shows full infrastructure ownership:

**Properties:**
1. registercall.com — WordPress editorial + Vite SPA
2. 5280.menu — Static watercolor redesign
3. copress-dashboard.vercel.app — THE SPINE (this app)
4. Colorado Gambler — gambling.conews.press vertical; ColoradoGambler.com forward candidate
5. 3CX Phone System — SIP extensions, AI receptionist
6. empire-courier.com — placeholder

## Colorado Gambler Campaign Kit

The imported `/cg-campaign-kit/` bundle comes from `/Users/Ace/Downloads/cg-campaign-kit.zip` and is served as static dashboard collateral:

- `/cg-campaign-kit/manifest.json`
- `/cg-campaign-kit/banners/banner-leaderboard-728x90.html`
- `/cg-campaign-kit/banners/banner-medium-rect-300x250.html`
- `/cg-campaign-kit/banners/banner-skyscraper-160x600.html`
- `/cg-campaign-kit/banners/banner-half-page-300x600.html`

## Deploy

```bash
# Vercel auto-deploys on every push to main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: ..."
git push origin main
```

`vercel.json` config:
```json
{ "version": 2, "cleanUrls": true, "trailingSlash": false }
```

`cleanUrls: true` means `newsletter.html` serves at `/newsletter` — no `.html` in URLs.

## Module Workbenches

These views are in `index.html` as `<div id="view-...">` sections. The JS view-switcher is already wired through `navTo(section)`.

```html
<div id="view-editorial">   <!-- Story queue, assignment form, daily list generator -->
<div id="view-directory">   <!-- Directory import staging and review lanes -->
<div id="view-cities">      <!-- Five-town readiness board -->
<div id="view-marketing">   <!-- Campaign brief to copy kit generator -->
<div id="view-accounting">  <!-- Invoice staging and billing handoff -->
```

Current behavior is intentionally browser-local:
- Editorial queue stores local drafts in `localStorage.copress_editorial_queue_v1` when Supabase credentials are missing.
- When `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are available, Editorial shows the 12 most recent `public_posts` rows and keeps the local queue as fallback.
- Directory import and invoice staging create operator handoff text in-page.
- Marketing campaign generation stores the latest kit in `localStorage.copress_campaign_handoff` and exposes a `Send to Newsletter Studio` link to `/newsletter?campaign=latest`; Newsletter Studio auto-loads that copy into the marketing template and shows a handoff banner.
- Marketing campaign kits follow the showcase pattern from `showcase.registercall.com/billsmobile`: branding first, industry pattern, invoice-manager item mapping, send options, follow-up/drip sequence, and newsletter/digital/print subscriber-list options.
- Campaign generation is local-first by default: free local Hermes/Ollama models generate copy and structure. Premium artwork is escalated only when the operator selects premium artwork, with Nano Banana 2 / Claude design / Google AI Studio noted as the art lane.
- Directory has a duplicable demo importer: source adapter → normalized business record → duplicate detection → review actions → JSON export. Demo state lives in `localStorage.copress_directory_batch_v1`.
- Directory intake includes visual evidence: a generated demo business-card wall plus an upload field for a photo of a card wall or scanned page from a local approved civic organization. Scan metadata lives in `localStorage.copress_directory_scan_meta_v1` and exports with the batch JSON.
- Directory scan intake now has an OCR / Parse Wall demo step. Parsed fields attach to staged records as `ocrFields`, including field confidence placeholders and scan label.
- Directory intake records include geography scope: `geographyType` (`town`, `zip`, `county`, `region`, or `event`) plus the entered town/ZIP/county value.
- Directory categories now cover restaurants, lodging, retail, services, civic organizations, schools, faith communities, government offices, tourism, professional services, legal/financial, home/garden, outdoor recreation, nonprofits, and more.
- Directory publish targets include city sites, print directory, newsletter feature block, social campaign queue, sales CRM follow-up, Build Kit queue, and Send Onboarding queue.
- Directory campaign kits are stored in `localStorage.copress_directory_campaign_kit` and include templates for Editorial Outreach, You're Invited, We'd Like Your Opinion, Claim Your Listing, Shop Local Welcome, Civic Partner Thank You, and Sponsor Prospect.
- Marketing Hub now links into the same shared intake engine instead of duplicating intake logic. Records carry `sourceTag` values such as `shoplocal`, `marketing-hub`, `editorial-outreach`, or `civic-scan`.
- Demo duplicate detection checks the staged batch plus a simulated main directory index (`MAIN_DIRECTORY_DB`); the same contract can be swapped to a real Supabase/main database lookup later.
- Final publishing, billing, and external writes still belong to the dedicated backend tools (`newsletter`, `invoicemanager-wrc`, Supabase, Stripe, Sendy).

Directory importer scaling pattern:
1. Replace `makeSeedBusinesses(...)` with a real source fetch or parser.
2. Keep `adaptDirectorySource(...)` to map Google Places, Apify, CSV, OCR scans/public walls, CRM, or scraper-specific shapes.
3. Keep `normalizeBusinessRecord(...)` as the canonical record contract.
4. Keep `detectDirectoryDuplicates(...)` and review statuses for operator approval.
5. Preserve `sourceTag` on every record so downstream marketing, Shop Local, editorial outreach, onboarding, and resident/business lists can share one dedupe path.
6. Move the same contract behind a backend when keys, publishing, or writes need server-side protection.
